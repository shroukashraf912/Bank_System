# Bank System

Welcome to the *Bank System* project, a comprehensive banking system developed using *C++* and *SQL Server. This project consists of two main interfaces: an **Admin Window* and a *Client Window*, designed to facilitate banking operations such as creating accounts, managing transactions, and handling secure operations.

## Features

### Admin Features
1. *Create New Account*:
   - Register new clients with the following details:
     - Full Name
     - Full Address
     - Age
     - National ID
     - Guardian National ID (if the client is under 21)
     - Initial Balance
   - Bank Account ID and Password are autogenerated for each account.
